//This section is going to focus on specific data dealing with objects and Arrays.

//ARRAYS
//Arrays are lines of code that holds data that can be added or removed. Lets use a
//room as an example. We can add people and remove them. The people are the data and the room is the Array.
//Arrays are a data structer. The two most important data structers in JS are Arrays and Objects
//Lets look at it as an example.
const friend1 = 'Mystic';
const friend2 = 'Asssassin';
const friend3 = 'BryBry';
//Saving friends to code like this can get annoying and tedious FAST!!!!! Even if
//we use all the shortcut tricks in the book we would still have to edit the specifics
//but we have arrays

//What we do here is instead of making a const for each friend, we name all the friends in a array and seperate them with commas. We still surround each individual name with quotes but we insert
//the commas outside the quotes. See the example below.
const psnFriends = ['Mystic', 'Assassin', 'BryBry', 'Zay', 'Greg', 'Shawn', 'Positivity', 'Echo', 'Retro'];
