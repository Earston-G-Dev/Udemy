Part 1.

JavaScriot is a High level, object Oriented, Multi-Paradigm(Can use diffirent Styles) Programming Language.

The 3 core technologies of the web are HTML,CSS, and Javascript
HTML is for content
CSS is for Presentation(styling). 
Javascript allows to add dynamic and interactive effects. It also manipulates content, load data from other remote servers. Creates web Applications.

A good analogy for these tools are Nouns, Adjectives and Verbs

Html is the noun an example is the <p><p> tag
As adjectives describe the nouns CSS gives description to the P tags like color,font, alignment, and format.

Javascript would then be the verb, meaning actions such as hide or do something.
